# OpenFlow

OpenFlow is basically a couple of [NodeRED](https://nodered.org/) installations and an API on top of a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance, using [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) for scalability. It is designed to supplement digitalization strategies by giving an easy to use, highly scalable and secure platform that supports human workflows, automation of IT systems and things (both Internet of things and  Industry Internet of things/Industry 4.0 ). It also functions as the dashboard and enabler of enterprise features for [OpenRPA](https://github.com/open-rpa/openrpa)

If in doubt, always use docker
For production environment we recommend moving to kubernetes
